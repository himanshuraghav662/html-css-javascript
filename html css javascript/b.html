    <a href="dm.html"><img src="dm.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></a><br>
Dairy Milk came to be known for its unique and loveable advertisement with catchy jingles throughout the years, which evolved. The chocolate was associated with the word 'Meetha' (sweet)- a strategy adopted to counter traditional sweets in India.

    <a href="munch.html"><img src="munch.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></a><br>
We cannot give this bar a higher safety rating because of the use of hydrogenated vegetable fats as an ingredient. Hydrogenated vegetable fats are a source of trans fatty acids or “trans-fats”, which are harmful to health. Trans-fats increase the likelihood of heart disease, stroke, cancer and many other ailments.
